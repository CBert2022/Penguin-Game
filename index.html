    <h1>Peet the brave Penguin</h1>
    <p>
        This is a cute game where a penguin is trying to catch some fish. The game is simple, but it's also challenging and fun. There are different levels to play, and each level gets more difficult. The goal is to catch as many fish as possible, and to get a high score.</p>
